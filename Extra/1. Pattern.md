Here are some examples of pattern programs that you can create using JavaScript. 
These examples cover different types of patterns, including simple patterns, pyramid patterns, and diamond patterns.

## 1. Print the Alphabet A to Z

```Javascript 
for(let i = 65; i <= 90; i++){
  let letter = String.fromCharCode(i);
  console.log(letter);
}
```
In this program, we're using the `String.fromCharCode()` method to convert the ASCII code to the corresponding character. 
We're starting the loop from the ASCII code of `A` (65) and ending it at the ASCII code of `Z` (90).

## 2. Print a Simple Pattern
```JavaScript 
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  let pattern = "";
  for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
    pattern += "* ";
  }
  console.log(pattern);
}
```
