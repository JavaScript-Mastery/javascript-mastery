# Day 1 - 

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript:

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. 
It was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995. 
Since then, it has become an essential component of web development and is supported by all modern web browsers.

## 2. Setting up your development environment:

Before you can start writing JavaScript code, you'll need to set up your development environment. 
You can use any code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

## 3. Running your first JavaScript code:

Once you have your development environment set up, you can start writing and running JavaScript code. 
Here's an example of a basic JavaScript program that prints a message to the console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

This program uses the `console.log()` function to print the message "Hello, world!" to the console. 
The `console.log()` function is a built-in function in JavaScript that outputs a message to the console.

## 4. Variables, data types, and operators:

Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. Here's an example of how to declare a variable:

```javascript
let name = "Ajay";
```

This declares a variable named `name` and initializes it with the value "John". 
The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript.

JavaScript supports several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, and objects. Here are some examples:

```javascript
let message = "Hello";
let age = 22;
let isStudent = true;
let person = { name: "Ajayu", age: 22 };
```

In this example, `message` is a string, `age` is a number, `isStudent` is a boolean, and `person` is an object.

JavaScript also supports various operators, such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators. 

Here are some examples:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b; // 15
let difference = a - b; // 5
let product = a * b;  // 50
let quotient = a / b; // 2
let isEqual = a === b; // false 
let isNotEqual = a !== b; // true
let isGreater = a > b; // true
let isLess = a < b;   // false
let andOperator = true && false;  // false
let orOperator = true || false; // true
let notOperator = !true;   // false
```

In this example, `sum` is the result of adding `a` and `b`, `difference` is the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, and so on.

That covers the basics of Day 1's concepts in JavaScript. 
Try practicing these concepts with some simple exercises to get comfortable with the language.
